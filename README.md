# pic10c_assignment3

This is the README file for PIC10C Assignment 3.

### Navigating this Repository
To get to ring_queue.cpp, go to the assign3 folder. Then, click the assign3 folder. I don't know how I got this repository to be this messy but there you will find ring_queue.cpp along with all the other files MSVS2017 made to build the project.

Or you can just click on this [link](https://github.com/jacquelinennguyen/pic10c_assignment3/tree/master/assign3/assign3).
